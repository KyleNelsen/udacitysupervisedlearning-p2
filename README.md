## Project: Creating Customer Segments with Arvato

### Overview
This is my project for the Unsupervised Learning part of the Udacity Data Analytics Nanodegree. It involves wrangling some datasets and using Kmeans clustering to find segments of the population that are popular and unpopular with a mail-order sales company in Germany. The data was only allowed to be used for the project and had to be deleted afterwards.
